1)theory+NLP concepts:stemming,tokenization and bag of words
2)create training data
3)pytorch model and training
4)save/load model and implement the chat

feedforward NN with two hidden layers.
It is for begineers for basic chatting

Image 1
with training data we have to use deep learning data
we cannot put directly string into model
we have to convert string into vector which contains numbers
so for this we are going to use concept of bag of words
if we wanted to apply bag of words we have to collect all words from the patterns
all different patterns will be put as single words in arrays
splitting our string into array

Image2
there will be all words 
but as per our pattern if that word matches to all words it will return 1 otherwise 0

Image3
words are in the vector form as input for feed forword neuralnet
output will be diff probabilities on diff classes

for getting string into vector we are applying two more methods
tokenization and stemming

Image4
tokenization: splitting a string into meaningful units
units words, punctuation characters and numbers ho sakte hai

Image5
stemming: means to take out root word from different words
results will differ because there are so many stemmers so based on which stemmer you apply it will give answer
in this we might loose actual meaning of words so we have to be careful about it
